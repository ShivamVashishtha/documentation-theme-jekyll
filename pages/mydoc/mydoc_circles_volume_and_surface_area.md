<h2>Circles, Volume, and Surface Area</h2><br>

<p>

We've covered the fundamentals of Congruency, Proofs, and Geometry. Finally, we'll move on to the more complicated topics of Circles, Volume, and Surface Area.

</p>

<p>

<h3><u>Circles</u></h3> <br>

<p><li>

<b>Arc of a Circle:</b> It is basically any portion of the circumference of a circle. The circumference is the perimeter of a circle. Hence, the circumference is a full arc of the circle.

<ul>

Finding the Length of an Arc:

<u>Arc Length:</u> The length of an arc is the distance between the start and end points of the arc. <br>

<b>Formula for the arc length = </b> $(2πr)$ $(θ/360)$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

<center>The length of the arc (drawn in red) is the distance from point A to point B.</center><br>

<br>

<center><b>Example:</b> Arc $AB$ has an angle of $40°$ and the circle has a radius of $7cm$. Calculate the length of arc $AB$.

<br>

<b>Answer:</b> $(2π7)$ $(40/360)$ = $4.884$ cm.

</ul>

</li></p>

<p><li>

<b>Area of Sector of a Circle:</b> Space enclosed by the sector of a circle.

<b>Formula = </b> Area of sector of circle = $(πr^2)$ $(θ/360)$, where $θ$ is the sector angle subtended by the arc at the center, <b>in degrees</b>. And, $r$ is the radius of the circle.

Area of sector of circle = $(\frac {1}{2})$ $(r^2 θ)$, where $θ$ is the sector angle subtended by the arc at the center, <b>in radians</b>. And, $r$ is the radius of the circle.
