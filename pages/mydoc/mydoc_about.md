At Mathular, we aim to provide middle-school, high-school, and college students with a database of resources where they can find out specific topics relating to their respective courses/classes. We believe that both theoretical and visual content should be available for students, as per their needs. Hence, we've tried our best to incorporate these ideologies in our work & content. [View our code here](https://github.com/0shaurya/mathular).

Use this website to access math resources that can help you enhance your knowledge about various topics, and even just to complete your daily assignments. Share this website with your friends as well, so that they can also use this website as an alternative to their textbooks!
