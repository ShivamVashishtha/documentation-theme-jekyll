<h2>Analytic Geometry</h2><br>

<p>

In the last topic, we covered the Congruency Proofs that are used in Geometry. Now, letâ€™s talk about some Analytic Geometry.

<br>

</p>

<p>

<b>Points on a Coordinate Plane:</b> We use a coordinate plane to show relative position.

Every point on the plane is described with an ordered pair in the form $(x,y)$, where $x$ represents the horizontal position, and $y$ represents the vertical position.

Points to the left of the origin have negative $x$-coordinates, and points to the right have positive $x$-coordinates.

Similarly, points below the origin have negative $y$-coordinates, and points above the origin have positive $y$-coordinates.

<br>

In this image, point $A$ is at $(4,3)$ and point $B$ is at $(-2,-3)$. Here, $(4,3)$ and $(-2,-3)$ are the ordered pairs.

<b>Distance:</b> The \(distance\) between the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by the following formula: $distance = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$

<br>

If we want to find the distance between two points, we can simply transform the two points, into a line, and then, into a right triangle.

</p>

<p>

<center>Example: <img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/rnp3_3fW2swYcRakLWYf9zRkZpU=/1279x1024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Distance_Formula-c9505b10ae88458f93c28324ad2f6a11.png" alt="Distance Example" style="width:75%;"></center></p>

<br><p>

With this right triangle in place, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: The expression for the base is $(x_2-x_1)$ and the expression for the length is $(y_2-y_1)$.

<br>

Now, we can use the formula: $unknown = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2$

But, we can solve for it: $unknown = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$

</p>

</p>

<p>

<b>Midpoint:</b> The midpoint of the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by the following formula: $midpoint = \frac {x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}$

<b>*Note about Parellel and Perpendicular Lines*:</b> Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. But, perpendicular lines have the negative reciprocal slope of the other line.
